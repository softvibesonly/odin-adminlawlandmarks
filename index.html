<p>
   <ul> <strong>Important Notes: </strong>
        <li>Not every tribunal required to give decisions</li>
        <li>The duty of procedural fairness in admin law is “eminently variable”</li>
        <li>Where reasons are required, they are the starting point for administrative decision-makers <em>ADMs</em> to show that their decisions were reasonable</li>
            <ol><strong>Some Reasons To Give Reasons:</strong>
                <li>Transparency</li>
                <li>Justification</li>
                <li>Intelligibility</li>
            </ol>
   </ul> 
</p>


<p><h2>2:<a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2012/2012scc12/2012scc12.html"><em>Doré v. Barreau du Québec</em></h2></p></a>

   <ul> <strong>Important Notes: </strong>
        <li>Normally, when judicially reviewing a discretionary admin decision made by adjudicator, the decision is reviewed for its reasonableness</li>
        <li>But when a Charter issue is involved, should the test be the same?</li>
        <li>An adjudicated admin decision is not the same as a law which can, in theory, be objectively justified by the state</li>
        <li>In the Charter context, reasonableness analysis is one that centers on proportionality</li>
            <ol><strong>We look at:</strong>
                <li>Does the decision interfere with the Charter right no more than is necessary, given statutory objectives?</li>
                <li>Does it reflect a proper balance of the mandate with Charter protections?</li>
            </ol>
   </ul>
